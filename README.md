## How does it work?

It is sufficient to copy downloaded validetta folder to root folder and attach essential folders to your web page. You don’t need to copy validetta folder to root folder but those are applied in the following expression as if validetta is copied to root folder.

include the dependent libraries and css files

```html
<link href="validetta/validetta.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" >

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="validetta/validetta.js"></script>
```

You can include language file if you want.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="validetta/languages/validettaLang-tr.js"></script>
```

Then, you will only need to call the plugin inside `$(document).ready function`:

```javascript
$(document).ready(function() {
    $("#form").validetta();
});
```
